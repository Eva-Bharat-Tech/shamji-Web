## Configuration Details

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.js` has been configured with:

- `base: '/shamji-Web/'` - Sets the correct base path for GitHub Pages
- `outDir: 'dist'` - Build output directory
- Asset optimization for production

### Package.json Scripts

- `npm run build` - Builds the production version
- `npm run deploy` - Builds and deploys to gh-pages branch
- `npm run preview` - Preview the built site locally

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Error on GitHub Pages:**

   - Make sure the `base` in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled and pointing to the correct source

2. **Assets not loading:**

   - Check that all asset paths are relative
   - Verify the `base` path is correct in Vite config

3. **Build fails:**
   - Run `npm run build` locally to check for errors
   - Fix any TypeScript/ESLint errors before deploying

### Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

1. **Add CNAME file:**

   - Create a `CNAME` file in the `public` folder
   - Add your domain name (e.g., `www.shamji-ads.com`)

2. **Update Vite config:**

   ```js
   export default defineConfig({
     base: "/", // Change to root for custom domain
     // ... other config
   });
   ```

3. **Configure DNS:**
   - Point your domain's DNS to GitHub Pages servers
   - Follow GitHub's custom domain documentation

## Site Structure

Your deployed site will include:

- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Custom fonts (Outfit and Poppins)
- Material-UI components
- Custom SVG assets
- Optimized images and assets

## Development vs Production

- **Development:** `bun run dev` - Runs on localhost:3000
- **Production:** Built and optimized for GitHub Pages
- **Preview:** `bun run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
2. Verify all file paths are correct
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Test the build locally before deploying
